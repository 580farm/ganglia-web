This should work like the normal Ganglia web UI. The difference is that
you need to make the conf/ directory writeable by the Apache user.

IMPORTANT:
You will need PHP JSON extension. It comes with PHP 5.2+. If you are on 5.1
use 

pecl install json

pecl is part of php-pear package on RHEL/CentOS. Make sure you have 

# cat /etc/php.d/json.ini 
extension=json.so
