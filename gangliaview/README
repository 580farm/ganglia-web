0. Requirements

- PHP
- Ganglia 
- A monitor dedicated for graphs, preferably hanging from the ceiling or wall. 
- A web browser running on a computer attached to said monitor

1. Limitations

At the present time, this is intended for a specific screen resolution and there is no easy
way to change this dynamically. If it doesn't quite fit, please manually alter the size of the
graphs using the numbers in graphview.php. 

2. What it does 

GangliaView  gives you a clean and simple view of one data source from Ganglia at a time. You can
name the data sources, and set the automatic rotation duration. 

We show two large graphs for last hour and last day and two smaller graphs with week and month 
view.

3. Configuration

The actual configuration of GangliaView is very simple. You do not even have to run GangliaView on
the same server as Ganglia Web Front end. Simply edit config.php 

In general all you need to do is add values to the $graphs array 

$graphs = array (
array("hostname" => "web01.domain.com", "cluster" => "Web", "metric_name" => "load_one", "title" => "web01 1 min load average" ),

You also should add a size in Ganglia configuration that specifies the size of large graphs. For
instance in my example I have added following to graph_sizes array in /gangali/conf.php e.g.

   'xlarge'=>array(
     'height'=>300,
     'width'=>650,
     'fudge_0'=>0,
     'fudge_1'=>0,
     'fudge_2'=>0
   ),


4. Using GangliaView

After configuration, open a browser (I suggest Google Chrome, more here:
http://laurie.denness.net/blog/2009/05/finding-a-web-browser-for-constant-page-reloading/ )
and point it to where you installed GangliaView. e.g. http://host/gangliaview

You should land at your first graph, and after the timeout, it will rotate to the next graph
in the array until it hits the last at which point it will start again at the being. This repeats
forever. 

5. Hints and tips

If displaying this unattended constantly, it is a good idea to use a method to turn off the 
display when no one will be looking at it (if possible!). On Windows, I provide a couple of
small .exe files, one which sleeps the displays, and one to wake them. You can then use 
Task Scheduler to have the monitors be controlled automatically. Using Linux, you can use
dpms to sleep and wake the monitors using cron. 

6. Power/resource saving

Ganglia View also supports configurable time when it's running. For instance you can define
that your office hours are from 9 to 6 pm. Outside those hours GangliaView will present
a simple banner instead of pulling images. That may give your Ganglia server a break. To 
define the hours change following variables in config.php

<pre>
$office_hour_min = 0;
$office_hour_max = 24;
</pre>

For turning the monitor off and on in Linux you would could do this from the command line 
or from cron

Turn Off: xset dpms force off
Turn On: xset dpms force on

I have it set in the cron this way. Turns on at 9am and turns off at 6 pm

0 18 * * mon-fri              export DISPLAY=:0.0 ; /usr/bin/xset dpms force off >> /dev/null
0 9 * * mon-fri               export DISPLAY=:0.0 ; /usr/bin/xset dpms force on >> /dev/null
